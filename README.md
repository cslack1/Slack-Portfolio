# Slack-Portfolio
Welcome to my public profile, a showcase of my work for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

# About Me
My name is Claire, and I am a student in the Telling Stores with Data course at CMU. I am a part time masters in public management (MPM) student at the Heinz College and expect to graduate in Spring 2021. I work full time at CMU in the Office of Human Resources (OHR) and have been with the university for four years. Collectively, I have worked in the HR and customer services fields for about 15 years and plan to continue working in the HR space after graduation. When I'm not at working or studying CMU, I enjoy the great outdoors - especially kayaking and hiking - and hanging out at home with my fat tabby cat, Muncie. 

# What I Hope to Learn
Although I am not a stranger to data, the craft of data visualization is new to me. I am an avid user of tables and pie charts, so I have a lot to learn. Most importantly, I hope to take away key lessons about visualization and put it to immediate good use in my day job. As a field, HR is working towards being more strategic and data-driven. I am a regular consumer of raw data but know my representation of this data is not where it needs to be. In my short time in this course, I can tell I may be doing a disservice to the leaders who consume my "data" in the tables and pie charts I am used to doing. I hope to learn not only core concepts of visualization but create and obtain feedback on real life data sets. My intention is to take full advtange of the opportunities within this course, not just make it to the end of the mini and get a decent letter grade. Above all, my goal is to learn core vizualization concepts and immediately apply what I learn to best display HR data to the client groups and leadership teams I support.
