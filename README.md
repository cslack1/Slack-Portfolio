# Slack-Portfolio
Welcome to my public profile, a showcase of my work for the Telling Stories with Data course at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

# About Me
My name is Claire, and I am a student in the Telling Stores with Data course at CMU. I am a part time masters in public management (MPM) student at the Heinz College and expect to graduate in Spring 2021. I work full time at CMU in the Office of Human Resources (OHR) and have been with the university for four years. Collectively, I have worked in the HR and customer services fields for about 15 years and plan to continue working in the HR space after graduation. When I'm not at working or studying CMU, I enjoy the great outdoors - especially kayaking and hiking - and hanging out at home with my fat tabby cat, Muncie. 

# What I Hope to Learn
Although I am not a stranger to data, the craft of data visualization is new to me. I am an avid user of tables and pie charts, so I have a lot to learn. Most importantly, I hope to take away key lessons about visualization and put it to immediate good use in my day job. As a field, HR is working towards being more strategic and data-driven. I am a regular consumer of raw data but know my representation of this data is not where it needs to be. In my short time in this course, I can tell I may be doing a disservice to the leaders who consume my "data" in the tables and pie charts I am used to doing. I hope to learn not only core concepts of visualization but create and obtain feedback on real life data sets. My intention is to take full advtange of the opportunities within this course, not just make it to the end of the mini and get a decent letter grade. Above all, my goal is to learn core vizualization concepts and immediately apply what I learn to best display HR data to the client groups and leadership teams I support.

# Assignment 2 - Government Debt Data

# Flourish Demonstration - Take 1
Following the instructions on Canvas, I constructed this chart to show government debt data from 1995 - 2019:

# Flourish Demonstration - Take 2 
I created a second data vizualization of an area chart using the same data. I removed the grid lines and chose a neutral blue color with shading underneath.

# Markdown Showdown: Flourish Demonstration Take 1 vs. Take 2
A line graph is a good visualzation tool to show changes over time but I experimented with other ways to display the data. Compared to other ways to view this data (ex. pie chart, bar chart, etc.), I still really like the individual line charts and did not change the visualization entirely. Instead, I made minor modifications to make it easier to read and quicker to compare between countries. First, I shaded the area underneath the line. When looking at all graphs, the shading makes the peaks and valleys more visible. This especially helps when you are looking at different countries simultaneously; it is easy to tell how much debt has changed just by having a shaded area to compare against. I also removed the grid lines so they were not crowding the space. Overall, changes are minimal but impactful. 

# Assignments 3 & 4
The data visualization I chose is a Workplace Violence infographic from the Society of Human Resources Management (SHRM) website. SHRM is the professional organization for HR professionals and provides members resources on relevant HR topics. Specifically, data analysis and visualization are hot topics within the HR field. HR professionals look to SHRM to provide the best knowledge-sharing and templates, so I wanted to see what examples SHRM is providing to enhance HR's knowledge of data visualization. I found one for Workplace Violence and was, admittedly, disappointed to see this was an example. https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/Pages/Workplace-Violence.aspx

The visualization screams "AN HR PERSON DID THIS!" The graphics are loud and fun. and the narrative portions share a lot of good information for HR professionals. However, while I understand the appeal of having fun picture and graphics, the visualization was very busy and difficult to read. After using the critique methods we learned, I could tell this visualization had relevant and important data; it was just unaccessible and not aesthetically-pleasing to look at. I felt the important information got lost in a world of bright colors and pictures, which distracted from the statistics and graphs. Instead of a bright, picture-filled visualization, I wanted a more muted and serious image to reflect a serious conversation. 

While I could have focused on one or two graphical representations, I wanted to redo the entire thing. First, I started by identifying the pieces of the visualization that needed immediate improvement: the color scheme, unclear graphics, and consistency instead of every graph known to man (except a pie chart). I wanted to the visual to be clean and easy to understand because although this graphic is intended for HR professionals, safety and security professionals typically co-adminster these programs with HR and do not operate well with loud and flowery diagrams; it's simply not their style and sets the wrong tone for a serious conversation like workplace violence. 

I received feedback from my housemates. They admitted my graphic was very boring in comparison to the one SHRM provided but it made more sense and was very straightforward. I believe more narratives and graphics would help the aesthetic but think overall the bones on this new visual are strong. For example, a stacked bar graph instead of the dotted verticle line graph reduced space and shows a clearer differenitation between employee, supervisor, and HR professionals' readiness during a workplace violence situation. I would change the scale and add more colors, pictures, and narratives like the original piece but not much else. 

Overall, I am happy with how the updated visual looks. It is much simpler and easier to read, sets a more serious tone for a serious conversation like workplace violence, and shares the same relevant information the original visualization provided without the unneccessary flair.
